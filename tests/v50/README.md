# KeDei LCD v 5.0
*Conjur* from forum https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1019562#p1019562 reverse engineered the init sequence for owned display (v5.0). He tested it on ESP8266 module and the driver he wrote using Arduino IDE (for ESP8266) .

If he say OK then I add here his code and some photos (if I gat any :) )
