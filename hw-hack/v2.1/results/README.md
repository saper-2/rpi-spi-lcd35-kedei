# Results H@CK

As I mentioned in parent forlder description, I made some short, but unfortunatly the one that got bad was not 4094 but the LCD itself :cry: .
You can find photos here if my one-side adapter-interface prototype, and how it's look like on (damaged) lcd...
I'm not going to buy next KeDei LCD so this is the last update of this repo...

The scripts ili/unili/ili-init works out of box :) .
